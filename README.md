# GEE-S2
A simple tutorial to download Sentinel-2 images over a specific administrative area using Google Earth Engine platform.

## Step 1: generate shape file of your ROI
The first step is to generate a shape file of your ROIs, which can be in various format, such as .shp. 
There are many ways to do it. One of the ways (that I used) is downloading via DIVA-GIS.

- download the shape files from [DIVA-GIS](https://diva-gis.org/) website.
- Load the shape file in [QGIS](https://qgis.org/de/site/), select the small ROI (eg. 'Bayern, Germany') and save to a shp. file.

## Step 2: setup on Google Earth Engine
